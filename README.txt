The project is developed in Java 8. 

To obtain a workspace of the project, create a new project using existing sources and point to the src file.
Note that running the project requires the IDE to include commons-math3-3.5.jar included in the project (this contains the used Zipf distrubtion).

The experiments themselves are run using the 3 dedicated methods in ARFDataTech class. Variables for the experiments can be easily adjusted and new experiments can be added.
